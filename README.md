# ML_Predict-the-loan-sanction-amount

## Introduction
- Buying a house requires a lot of caring plan. Once you have finalized your budget and the house that you want to buy, you must ensure that you have sufficient funds to pay the seller.
- With rising property rates, most people avail home loans to buy there dream houses. 
- The bank only lend up to 80% of the total amount based on a personâ€™s finances (salary ,outgoing expenses , existing loans , etc.).
- You will need to make the rest of the payment yourself after the bank tells you how much they can lend.

## Problem Statement

- There are many regression methods like Linear Regression , Ridge Regression ,Lasso Regression , Random Forest Regressor and many more.
But fortunately Linear Regression gives us excellent result , this is because of preprocessing ; in short it's the power of rectify the skewness and outliers inside the data.
- Linear regression is the work horse of statistics and (supervised) machine learning. When augmented with kernels or other forms of basis function expansion, it can model also nonlinear relationships. And when the Gaussian output is replaced with a Bernoulli or multinoulli distribution, it can be used for classification.
